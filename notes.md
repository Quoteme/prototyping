# Presentation notes

## Motivation

- large field / may become its own course in the coming years
  - ![screenshot from `02_UXDM.pdf` from ILIAS](./assets/future_course.png)

## Part of various design paradigms

- UCD (User-Centered Design)
- reason:
  - Reminder: “User-centered design (UCD) describes a process that generates products and
    services with a high degree of User Experience (UX) by focusing on gaining a deep
    understanding of users.“ (Weichert et al. 2019)
  - Prototyping involves users in the design process
- ![Phase 3/4 in the UCD process](./assets/ucd_process_phase.png)
  - reminder:
    - develop various _prototpyes_
    - use prototypes to _communicate_ with
      - stakeholders
      - participants
      - decision-makers
      - users
    - develop _common understanding_
- also ![Phase 4/4 in the UCD process](./assets/ucd_process_phase_2.png)
  - reminder:
    - use prototypes for _usability testing_
    - _actual users_ test the prototypes
    - in _realistic scenarios_
- ![part of design thinking](./assets/design_thinking_base.png)
  - reminder:
    - designed to improve _innovation_
- ![part of agile development](./assets/agile_software_development_base.png)
  - reminder:
    - _iterative_ development
    - _incremental_ development
    - _flexible_ development

## Takes different forms [^1]

- **Proof-of-Principle Prototype**: Verifies key functions
- **Working Prototype**: Near-final functionality
- **Visual Prototype**: Shows size, appearance
  - **Form Study Prototype**: Emphasizes geometry & less color/material
- **User Experience Prototype**: For user research
  - **Usability Testing**
  - **Realistic Interactions**
  - **Feedback Collection**
  - **Iterative Improvement**
  - **User-Centered Design**
- **Functional Prototype**:
  - Shows function, appearance / not final scale, manufacturability, ...
- **Paper Prototype**:
  - Early UI testing on paper. Confirm and communicate design ideas

### Bias

## Measuring the user experience

![Tullis_and_Albert_chapter_3](./assets/Tullis_and_Albert_chapter_3_base.png)[^2]

### Formative effects of prototyping

- reminder:

  - "To find out _improvement areas_ prior to release" (`03_UXDM.pdf`)
    - ![Part 3/4 of the UCD process](./assets/UCD_base.png)

- Key Questions & Answers:
  - **What usability issues block user goals?**  
    _Discover issues through prototype testing_
  - **What aspects work well or frustrate?**  
    _Observe user interactions with prototypes_
  - **What common errors are users making?**  
    _Identify errors in prototype use_
  - **What issues may remain post-launch?**  
    _Predict challenges from prototype feedback_
  - **How can prototypes enhance understanding?**  
    _Use prototypes to align with users_
  - **What feedback can improve design?**  
    _Iterate based on prototype insights_

### Summative effects of prototyping

- reminder:

  - "To determine the _quality of UX_ against a set of criteria" (`03_UXDM.pdf`)
    - ![Part 4/4 of the UCD process](./assets/UCD_base.png)

- Key Questions & Answers:
  - **Did we meet UX/usability goals?**  
    _Verify goals using final prototype tests_
  - **What is the overall UX quality?**  
    _Evaluate user experience with polished prototype_
  - **How does our product compare?**  
    _Benchmark prototype against competitor models_
  - **Have we improved since last release?**  
    _Compare current prototype to prior versions_

## Applications of prototypes

- comparing designs
  - ![Albert and Tullis - 3.3.10](./assets/why_prototypes_-_comparing_designs.png)
- online surveys
  - ![Albert and Tullis - 3.4.3](./assets/why_prototypes_-_online_surveys.png)
  - ![click heat map](./assets/why_prototypes_-_click_heat_map.png)[^3]
- performance metrics
  - user efficiency
    - ![Mean time per Task](./assets/why_prototypes_-_performance_metrics.png)[^4]
    - ![Average Efficiency](./assets/why_prototypes_-_performance_metrics_2.png)[^4]
- testing
  - user success in A/B testing
    - ![Test setup](./assets/why_prototypes_-_task_success_rate.png)[^4]
    - ![Task Success Rate](./assets/why_prototypes_-_task_success_rate_2.png)[^4]

### Märchenstunde dazu

- Prototype of a high-voltage detector
- Phase 2/4 UCD
  - Discussion with developers
    - ![LEDs](./assets/why_prototypes_-_high_voltage_detector.png)
    - If wrong LED is on, user could die
  - Developers did _not want to change_ LEDs
- Phase 3/4 UCD
  - Prototyp has been build
    - **Simulates** 20% probability, measured object is high voltage
- Phase 4/4 UCD
  - 100 Participants
  - One misinterpretation

#### Resultat

Developers got convinced to change LEDs
